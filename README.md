My weekly commits for the tidytuesday project
---------------------------------------------

I‚Äôve discovered this challenge during another challenge :) the
\#100DaysOfCode challenge. i‚Äôve started during March 2020 quarantine for
covid19. Hope one day will look back at these days and find a reason to
smile and be happy about what i‚Äôve accomplished.

### Year 2020 Episode 15: Tour de France

I don‚Äôt know shit about Tour De France. Very very bad, i agree. In fact,
one of my first questions to address was actually discover why i‚Äôm so
uninterested in this sport. Too boring? too low profile? Does it depend
on the geographical area where i was born? In the end i‚Äôve just (badly)
plotted the age of the most winning teams.. Interesting? Well, it still
demonstrates that 30+ doesnt mean you‚Äôre done.

### Year 2020 Episode 16: BBC - Survey - HipHop

This was a cool one. All of us love music right? I enjoyed digging into
this dataset from BBC where a bunch of critics were asked what was their
HipHop top 5 personal rank of all time. After a week of r4ds studying,
youtube screencasts, i‚Äôve actually learned what are the basic steps to
*easily* handle and explore a dataset. As DR says: ‚ÄúAlways start
exploring the categorical variables with some counting‚Äù. After that it
comes naturally to focus on some of them, summarize, and search for
relationships between each other. Here, it was clear that the most voted
songs belong to the 90s and the level has been decreasing since then.
That‚Äôs embarassing but i‚Äôve no idea about who Public Enemy is!!

### Year 2020 Episode 16: BBC - Survey - HipHop - followup

I was not satisfied with my plots. For several reasons:  
\* There are two plots and not one \* I‚Äôm kind of tired to show in the
same plot a lot of information. What do you want to accomplish? This is
not a scientific paper. That‚Äôs direct communication. \* I didn‚Äôt like
the time on the y-axis, it makes it kind of weird So im showing here the
main (obvious?) message extracted from the data.  
**important**: I‚Äôve read the code of i think about the ~80% of the
\#tidytuesday plots i‚Äôve seen. That was so instructive.
