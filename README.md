## my weekly commits for the tidytuesday project

Background: I've discovered this challenge during my a #100DaysOfCode challenge i've started during this 2020 quarantine for covid19. Hope one day to look back at these days and find a reason to smile and be happy of what i've accomplished.

## 1st tt: Tour de France
I don't know shit about Tour De France. Very very bad, i agree. In fact, one of my first questions to address was actually discover why i'm so uninterested in this sport. Too boring? too low profile? Does it depend on the geographical area where i was born? In the end i've just (badly) plotted the age of the most winning teams.. Interesting? Well, it still demonstrates that 30+ doesnt mean you're done.
