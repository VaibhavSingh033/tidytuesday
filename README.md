# tidytuesday
## my weekly commits for the tidytuesday project

_Background_  
I've discovered this challenge during another challenge :) the #100DaysOfCode challenge. i've started during March 2020 quarantine for covid19. Hope one day will look back at these days and find a reason to smile and be happy about what i've accomplished.

### Year 2020 Episode 15: Tour de France
I don't know shit about Tour De France. Very very bad, i agree. In fact, one of my first questions to address was actually discover why i'm so uninterested in this sport. Too boring? too low profile? Does it depend on the geographical area where i was born? In the end i've just (badly) plotted the age of the most winning teams.. Interesting? Well, it still demonstrates that 30+ doesnt mean you're done.

### Year 2020 Episode 16: BBC - Survey - HipHop
This was a cool one. All of us love music right? I enjoyed digging into this dataset from BBC where a bunch of critics were asked what was their HipHop top 5 personal rank of all time. After a week of r4ds studying, youtube screencasts, i've actually learned what are the basic steps to *easily* handle and explore a dataset. As DR says: "Always start exploring the categorical variables with some counting". After that it comes naturally to focus on some of them, summarize, and search for relationships between each other. Here, it was clear that the most voted songs belong to the 90s and the level has been decreasing since then. That's embarassing but i've no idea about who Public Enemy is!!
